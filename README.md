2D games built with Ruby and a Library named Gosu!

Its superfun to code with Gosu.

Then open CMD/Terminal and Enter this command -

      gem install Gosu
 
Then go to the Game's directory that you have cloned/downloaded from here and open CMD/Terminal and Enter-

      ruby GameName.rb
      
      
Note - Every game that is written in ruby closes if you press Esc anytime!.
